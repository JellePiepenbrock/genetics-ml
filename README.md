# genetics-ml

A repository in which I keep track of papers in which machine learning was applied to topics related to genetics, which includes epigenomics, proteomics, population genetics, and so on. This repo is mostly for myself, I will maybe try adding "main contributions" for each paper that I add. 

1. [General Machine Learning](#general)



2. [Machine Learning in Genomics](#mlgenom)
